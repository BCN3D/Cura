[1.1.0]
*Upgrade to latest firmware version (internet connection required).
*Upload custom firmware.
*New parameter to set minimum time to cool down to standby temperature.
*New arranging strategy.
Objects in platform will be sorted following a grid pattern.
*New Configuration profiles
Seeking for the most versatile base parameters so your prints finish flawlessly, right out of the box. We have changed a few parameters in order to improve your machine’s reliability and print quality.
This changes include refinements to get a better surface finish while printing slightly faster. Better support settings
When using both extruders, prime tower is enabled by default to get the highest reliability. Note you can always turn it off and switch on SmartPurge to prime only in the purge tray.
For the same reason, auto temperature is disabled by default. Enabling it, Cura will choose automatically the right temperature to print each layer, avoiding print temperature value even if it’s been manually adjusted.
We have also added profiles for Colorfabb composite materials.
*Bug fixes
Creating new materials works as expected.
Multiplying works as expected when duplication/mirror mode is enabled.
Smart Purge is set correctly per extruder.
First extrusion fixed in special cases.
Now slice doesn't show errors when using duplication/mirror and 1.00mm Hotend.
Centering models doesn't rotate them.
Other minor fixes.
[1.0.3]
*New parameters to improve Smart Purge control.
*New icon color.
*New logo.
*Bug fixes
Now Smart Purge works as expected.
Config files won't create conflicts with older versions.
[1.0.2]
*Bug fixes
Center models in the printing zone when duplication/mirror mode.
No layers missing in dual extrusion prints.
Smart Purge and Prevent Grinding Filament settable per extruder.
Keep Print Mode when switching profiles.
[1.0.1]
*Reset camera position.
New view mode to reset the camera position.
*Bug fixes
When printing raft now starts extruding the right amount.
Tool change for dual extrusion prints doesn't crash in some cases.
[1.0.0]
*Mirror and Duplication modes
Unleash the full potential of your Sigmax. Choose new print modes to use both extruders at the same print. Cloning or mirroring the same model.
*ProGen profile integration
All integrated profiles are designed by our ProGen tool.
*Prevent grinding filament
Another advantadge of the IDEX technology. Now you can define a maximum number of retractions to be executed at the same piece of filament, when this number is reached the hotend will prime the right amount in the container to allow the extruder work on a new and clean piece of filament.
*Heat only used hotends
Winter is coming. Also for the unused hotend.
*Smart purge
Prime oozed material in the container. And only when it's needed. And only the right amount.
*Reduce retraction
Experimental feature to retract only on outer surface.
*New theme
Yes!
*Custom fixes
Adjusting temperature oscilation, zhops on tool changes and a few more. Specific for our IDEX machines.
