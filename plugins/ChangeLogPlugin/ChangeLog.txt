*ProGen profile integration
All integrated profiles are designed by our ProGen tool.
*Prevent grinding filament
Another advantadge of the IDEX technology. Now you can define a maximum number of retractions to be executed at the same piece of filament, when this number is reached the hotend will prime the right amount in the container to allow the extruder work on a new and clean piece of filament.
*Heat only used hotends
Winter is coming. Also for the unused hotend.
*Smart purge
Prime oozed material in the container. And only when it's needed. And only the right amount.

Experimental feature to retract only on outer surface.
*New theme

*Custom fixes
Adjusting temperature oscilation, zhops on tool changes and a few more. Specific for our IDEX machines.
